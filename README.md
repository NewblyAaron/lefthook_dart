# lefthook-dart

A Dart wrapper for [Lefthook](https://github.com/evilmartians/lefthook) â€” the fast and powerful Git hooks manager.

## About this project

This is a community-maintained continuation of the original [project-cemetery/lefthook](https://github.com/project-cemetery/lefthook) package, which served as a simple Dart CLI wrapper around the Lefthook binary.

The original repository is no longer maintained. This fork updates the tool for modern Dart/Flutter projects, ensuring compatibility, reliability, and ease of use.

For detailed usage and configuration options, refer to the official [Lefthook documentation](https://github.com/evilmartians/lefthook).

## Installation

```sh
pub global activate lefthook-dart
